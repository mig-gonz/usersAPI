# usersAPI

The `usersAPI` is a specialized API designed to provide mock user data for developers seeking object-oriented information to use as placeholder content in their frontend applications.

## Purpose

Modern frontend development often requires realistic data to populate user interfaces during the development and testing phases. Creating such data manually can be time-consuming and repetitive. The `usersAPI` aims to alleviate this challenge by offering a curated collection of mock user information.
